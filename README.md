## 🚀 Project Overview

The "Cordel Moderno" project is a simple yet elegant single-page website designed to showcase a poem in the style of Brazilian "cordel" literature. The main goal was to apply advanced CSS techniques, such as the parallax effect, to create an engaging and visually appealing reading experience.


## ✨ Highlights & Features

- **Parallax Scrolling:** Background images on certain sections remain fixed as the user scrolls (`background-attachment: fixed`), creating a beautiful depth effect.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout and typography are fluid, adapting to different screen sizes primarily through the use of viewport units (`vw`).
- **Custom Typography:** Utilizes custom fonts from Google Fonts ('Freeman' for the title and 'Dekko' for the poem) to capture the aesthetic of cordel pamphlets.
- **Enhanced Readability:** Text over background images is placed within a semi-transparent container to ensure it remains legible even against complex backgrounds.
